  <h2>Episode 1</h2>
  <p>Once a group that had utilised powerful magic to protect the kingdom, the Holy Knights have instead now staged a coup d'Ã©tat and overthrown the king, now ruling with oppression and tyranny. Elizabeth Liones, the third princess of the Kingdom of
    Liones, sets out on a mission to find the Seven Deadly Sins, a team of extremely powerful but dangerous former Holy Knights now branded as wanted criminals for supposedly betraying the kingdom ten years ago, and have now separated and gone into
    hiding. Plagued by exhaustion from her escape from the castle, she soon finds Meliodas, the owner of a bar named the Boar Hat, accompanied by his pet companion Hawk, a talking pig. However when Elizabeth is chased to the bar and attacked by
    apprentice Holy Knight Twigo, Meliodas easily overpowers the opponent, revealing his identity in the process as the captain of the Seven Deadly Sins and the bearer of the Dragon's Sin of Wrath.</p>

  <h2>Episode 2</h2>
  <p>Meliodas agrees to help Elizabeth, revealing how his business has been travelling from place to place to acquire information about the rest of the Seven Deadly Sins as well and letting her join him. The two, along with Hawk, soon stop over at
    the Bernia Village, a village famed for their delicious Bernia ale and its primary source of income. However, a Holy Knight Gilthunder has planted his sword in the center of the town, stopping all water sources. Despite the villagers' futile
    efforts, Meliodas easily removes the object and his hailed as a saviour of the Bernia Village. Gilthunder, wanting to confirm whether the removal of his sword was an accident or not, throws a spear imbued with his power towards the town, which
    is reflected back in the same direction by Meliodas, destroying Fort Solgales, Gilthunder's current location, and missing his head by centimetres.</p>

  <h2>Episode 3</h2>
  <p>Meliodas, Elizabeth and Hawk travel to the Forest of White Dreams, a foggy, dense forest where even the Holy Knights avoid. Inhabiting the forest are Prankster Imps, which harbour shapeshifting abilities that confuse travellers by impersonating
    their companions. After defeating the Prankster Imps, they find a Giant girl asleep in the forest, who introduces herself as Diane, a member of the Seven Deadly Sins who possesses the Serpent's Sin of Envy, declaring her crush on Meliodas. This
    surprise reunion is soon interrupted when Gilthunder arrives, binding all of them with his lightning magic and facing Meliodas in a one-on-one fight, where the latter is dealt a severe injury. Under the pretense of dying, he acquires information
    about the whereabouts of two members of the Seven Deadly Sins, Ban and King, as his apparent last wish, tracing their locations to the Baste Dungeon and the Capital of the Dead respectively.</p>

  <h2>Episode 4</h2>
  <p>Diane throws Gilthunder out of the forest and decides to accompany Meliodas, Elizabeth and Hawk on their travels. Their next stop is Baste Dungeon, where Ban, the bearer of the Fox's Sin of Greed, has been imprisoned for five years. However,
    Meliodas collapses suddenly from his injury and they decide to stop at Dalmary Town, letting a doctor named Dana treat him with medicine. There, Diane and Elizabeth both show care for Meliodas, but display envy towards each other due to their
    opposites in strength and size, with Diane ultimately deciding to leave to find Ban herself. Unbeknownst to them, Dalmary Town is currently under the rule of the Weird Fangs, a unit in the Holy Knights, who are determined to kill Meliodas and
    Diane, and capture Elizabeth. Dana also unexpectedly reveals to a shocked Elizabeth that the supposed medicine he administered is a deadly poison, while Golgius, a member of Weird Fangs, appears out of the blue to escort her back to the Kingdom
    of Liones.</p>
